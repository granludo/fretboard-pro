## functioning

A web form (on /front-end forlder ) invoques a web app (implemented webs.py file) and returns an HTML file with 
the description of the fretboar (tables of fret positions and so on) and the links to the PDF file with a 1:1 scale drawing of the 
fretboard ( including fret positions, nut, intonnated bridge and string positions ) and a DXF file.

conf.json file informs the URL of the output folder so the links are usable.
